Look down, you can edit and preview this React code! ðŸ¤¯

import ReactLivePlayground from "react-live-playground"
import dracula from "prism-react-renderer/themes/dracula"

export const code = `
function Button() {
  return (
    <div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
      <button
        onClick={() => alert("Hello World!")}
        style={{
          border: 'none',
          textAlign: 'center',
          boxSizing: 'border-box',
          textDecoration: 'none',
          padding: '10px 40px',
          cursor: 'pointer',
          background: '#D4AF37',
          background: 'linear-gradient(to bottom, #D4AF37 0%, #C5A028 100%)',
          boxShadow: '0 4px 6px rgba(50, 50, 93, .11), 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, .08)',
          color: 'white',
          fontSize: '18px', fontWeight: '700',
          borderRadius: '25px'
        }}
      >
        Gold button
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
`.trim()

<div className="react-live-playground">
  <ReactLivePlayground code={code} theme={dracula} />
</div>

Pretty cool, right?

## Instructions and Sample code

You can get this exact thing in your React project, too â€“Â a blog, documentation site, whatever!

First install the [react-live-playground NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-live-playground) to a React project. Then, simply import it as a regular component and use it as you wish. Make sure to include pass the `code` prop as a string, which can be either pure JSX, a pure functional component, or a React class component. For the full list of props, see the [package README](https://github.com/thomaswang/react-live-playground#props)!

#### Sample

```js
import ReactLivePlayground from "react-live-playground"
import dracula from "prism-react-renderer/themes/dracula"

export const code = `
function Button() {
  return (
    <div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
      <button
        onClick={() => alert("Hello World!")}
        style={{
          border: 'none',
          textAlign: 'center',
          boxSizing: 'border-box',
          textDecoration: 'none',
          padding: '10px 40px',
          cursor: 'pointer',
          background: '#D4AF37',
          background: 'linear-gradient(to bottom, #D4AF37 0%, #C5A028 100%)',
          boxShadow: '0 4px 6px rgba(50, 50, 93, .11), 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, .08)',
          color: 'white',
          fontSize: '18px', fontWeight: '700',
          borderRadius: '25px'
        }}
      >
        Gold button
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
`.trim()

<ReactLivePlayground code={code} theme={dracula} />
```

_Note_: This sample from above was written in a `.mdx` file, which is an extension of `.md` files that lets you use JSX in your Markdown. I recently refactored [gatsby-personal-starter-blog](https://github.com/thomaswang/gatsby-personal-starter-blog/commit/2bef261cb22800ac3c05f9a2e78b6cb27db1a347) to include [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). If you also have a Gatsby blog, it's a cool feature to have to show off React components in your blog posts. React Live Playground can be used in a regular React `.js` file just fine though!

## How and why I built this

The good folks over at [Formidabble](https://github.com/FormidableLabs) make some pretty dope tools. They made [component-playground](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/component-playground) and more recently [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live), which I wrapped to make this component.

I made this component because although the [React Live Demo](https://react-live.netlify.com/) ([demo folder](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live/tree/master/demo)) is nice, having the preview side-by-side with the code is too narrow for my blog. Also, to use React Live out-of-the-box, you have to include 4 separate components â€“ `<LiveProvider />`. `<LiveEditor />`. `<LiveError />`, and `<LivePreview />`.

I'm a believer that things should _just work_, and making this component solved this problem for me. I hope it might be helpful for you as well!

**Happy React-ing!** ðŸ‘»
